# AdventOfCode
This is my code for doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

### Organization:
- the input files are stored in the folder `/inputs` as `dayX.txt` where X is the day of the challenge
- the code for each day (and sometimes part 2 for some days) is in `main.py` in a function called `dayX` or `dayX_part2` where X is the day of the challenge
- there are different branches for different years and main is the most recent year
